@ngrx/store Demo Application as presented in [Comprehensive Introduction to @ngrx/store](https://gist.github.com/btroncone/a6e4347326749f938510) with the following cosmetic changes:

 * The source files are partitioned into two directories - ui and store.
 * Barrels were added to the ui and store directories
 * Minor syntax fixes
 * Arranged as an Angular 2 application as explained in the [Angular 2 Quick Start Guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html)

Other than that, it is a faithful copy.
